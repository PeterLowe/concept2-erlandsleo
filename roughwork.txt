3-4 fundementals of this game
The core concept of the game is obviously parkour, but in multiple gravities!!
You can travel to multiple planets and every planet has their unique missions, different garvity and different enemies.
Combat is also different, the less the gravity, the slower and majestic the combat is going to be!
