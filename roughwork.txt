3-4 fundementals of this game
The core concept of the game is obviously parkour, but in multiple gravities!!
You can travel to multiple planets and every planet has their unique missions, different garvity and different enemies.
Combat is also different, the less the gravity, the slower and majestic the combat is going to be!

Market analysis [EB]
This is just the latest addition to a franchise that people have enjoyed over the last decade.
It's up there with other beloved freemode story games such as Far Cry and more.
This is targetted towards late teens to adult customers due to mild gore in the game.
Expected sales are gonna be easily into millions and will make a profit that will go into millions.
